## About me
Hi, My name is Siu Hang. You can call me Peter. I have a background in media design, specialised in motion graphic. I used various digital softwares to make artworks, when I was studying in college. I started to realise the power of technology. I find myself fall in love to art and technology, and want to make use of both.

Although, I got a slight touch in computer science and programming, I still lack confidence in software development. Someday soon, I thought the reason behind is that the traditional teaching and learning methods are too theoretical, which mean lack of practical use. Since then, I started to spend my spare time to self-taught for game, web and interactive coding.

I think now is the best time self-taught about programming. There are tons of resources on the internet that we can make use of. Most of them are free of charge, or even open source.
